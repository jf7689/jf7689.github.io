                                Developed in a production studio course, my role on this team was programming focused on the game's shop and game balancing. I learned to 
                                make UI utilizing Unity's UI system. By taking feedback from external and internal playtest, I was able to iterate on the shop's UI and 
                                functionalities. The feedback I got from the first major iteration of the shop was that it felt like too much was going on, hard to follow, not 
                                intuitive and too much reading to do. The unit purchasing screen became a scrolling shop interface. Less cards are now on the screen at once and 
                                it allowed for the size of unit cards to be increased. This size increase enabled me to add the stat information to the front of the cards and 
                                get rid of the flip card functionality. Then I requested for art assets to replace stat text, such as "health", to reduce the amount 
                                of reading required. The ability purchasing screen became a toybox inventory of purchased units where you can clearly see each unit that was 
                                bought. Instead of having purchasable ability cards, having an upgrade button on the purchased unit makes for better association between the unit
                                and its specific ability. Although there is less information about abilities, the ability names are pretty self explanatory and I opted for a 
                                play and learn experience for the player that fits with the theme of playing with toys in a sandbox. Overall making the shop's flow more 
                                streamlined for the user. Lastly, I made tool tips on the upgrade buttons to show the cost and ability names. Balancing units and abilities was
                                a mixture of playtesting, and using a spreadsheet to find values that made people feel each unit served a purpose while the game's difficulty 
                                increases.

                                An Encroaching Sickness is a Skyrim quest mod made for a modding class. My role in this team was designing and building a level.
                                I learned how to use Bethesda's level editor in order to do this. The goal of the level is to have the player explore and 
                                fight enemies in order to collect ingriedients to complete the quest. I placed rocks, dirt, vegetation and other environmental objects to try 
                                making a cave that looks as natural as possible. Using props, I tried make rooms that communicated the narative and theme of the mod. Some
                                rooms were meant to look like they had been attacked by monsters and others to look lived in but showing the scarcity of personal items that
                                belong to the sick people living within the cave. In addition, I included a few mini environmental narratives for the player to discover. Such 
                                as a couple's skeleton holding hands hidden away in a corner of a room behind piles of firewood, suggesting they were hiding from the monsters
                                in the cave until they passed away.

                                Blob Blob Game is a 2D game about controlling blobs to solve puzzles. This game was originally a class project but we decided to continue 
                                working on it over the course of the summer. In this team I communicated with team members to conceptualize mechanics to include 
                                in the game. My main role was making levels and testing our mechanics for bugs since I was experimenting with mechanics the most. I tried to 
                                create easy to difficult levels. When all the levels were finished, I went back over them to reorganize the levels so that the player learns
                                mechanics and the various ways to work with them in the order we want them to. In addition, for the levels to progressively get more difficult
                                but have some easier levels in between to prevent the player from feeling constantly stuck. For this project I learned how to use Trello for 
                                better team organization, tasks prioritization and distribution.

                            This is a prototype for a idle game made for a web class. The prototype demonstrates the art style, UI and a basic premise of the game being about 
                            collecting resources to grow a village. Using Figma, I created wireframes to layout two screens for the game. A main screen showing the starting 
                            village, resources in the game, number of workers for each resource and a button to get to the upgrade screen. In the upgrade screen, the player 
                            can buy workers for each resource to increase the rate of earning the resource and click on a button to return to the main screen. I learned to use
                            Pixi.js to render images onto the screen and I used howler.js to add background music. This was my first time making pixel art and I learned how to make it in Photoshop. Given the 2 weeks I had
                            to do this project, I ended up spending too much time on trying to get the art to look good that I ended up not having enough time to get
                            some of the mechanics I wanted to include. From this experience, I learned that for games it's best to prioritize mechanics first when just trying
                            to make a playable prototype.
