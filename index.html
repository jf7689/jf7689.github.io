                        I'm a recent graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Game Design and Development. 
                        While I once found large problems overwhelming, I've learned to approach challenges by breaking them down into smaller, 
                        manageable parts and solving them step by step. This mindset has strengthened my confidence in tackling complex issues 
                        by researching new topics and continuously expanding my knowledge to develop effective solutions. I'm eager to work on
                        projects that push me to think critically, grow my expertise, and contribute to building and scaling impactful solutions. 
                        Currently, I'm seeking opportunities in backend development and software engineering.

                                VodTTV is a website designed to streamline the process of browsing through Twitch VODs. Unlike Twitchâ€™s limited filtering options, which only allow 
                                sorting by the latest and most popular content, VodTTV introduces more search and filter functionalities. VodTTV allows users to search VODs by title, 
                                filter by latest, oldest, most popular, year, month and reversing the order of VODs. These features collectively enhance the user's ability to find 
                                desired VODs efficiently, offering a more pleasant and effective browsing experience. The website is responsive to different resolutions.

                                Developed in a production studio course, my role on this team was programming focused on the game's shop and game balancing. I learned to 
                                make UI utilizing Unity's UI system. By taking feedback from external and internal playtest, I was able to iterate on the shop's UI and 
                                functionalities. The feedback I got from the first major iteration of the shop was that it felt like too much was going on, hard to follow, not 
                                intuitive and too much reading to do. The unit purchasing screen became a scrolling shop interface. Less cards are now on the screen at once and 
                                it allowed for the size of unit cards to be increased. This size increase enabled me to add the stat information to the front of the cards and 
                                get rid of the flip card functionality. Then I requested for art assets to replace stat text, such as "health", to reduce the amount 
                                of reading required. The ability purchasing screen became a toybox inventory of purchased units where you can clearly see each unit that was 
                                bought. Instead of having purchasable ability cards, having an upgrade button on the purchased unit makes for better association between the unit
                                and its specific ability. Although there is less information about abilities, the ability names are pretty self explanatory and I opted for a 
                                play and learn experience for the player that fits with the theme of playing with toys in a sandbox. Overall making the shop's flow more 
                                streamlined for the user. Lastly, I made tool tips on the upgrade buttons to show the cost and ability names. Balancing units and abilities was
                                a mixture of playtesting, and using a spreadsheet to find values that made people feel each unit served a purpose while the game's difficulty 
                                increases.

                                An Encroaching Sickness is a Skyrim quest mod made for a modding class. My role in this team was designing and building a level.
                                I learned how to use Bethesda's level editor in order to do this. The goal of the level is to have the player explore and 
                                fight enemies in order to collect ingriedients to complete the quest. I placed rocks, dirt, vegetation and other environmental objects to try 
                                making a cave that looks as natural as possible. Using props, I tried make rooms that communicated the narative and theme of the mod. Some
                                rooms were meant to look like they had been attacked by monsters and others to look lived in but showing the scarcity of personal items that
                                belong to the sick people living within the cave. In addition, I included a few mini environmental narratives for the player to discover. Such 
                                as a couple's skeleton holding hands hidden away in a corner of a room behind piles of firewood, suggesting they were hiding from the monsters
                                in the cave until they passed away.

                                Blob Blob Game is a 2D game about controlling blobs to solve puzzles. This game was originally a class project but we decided to continue 
                                working on it over the course of the summer. In this team I communicated with team members to conceptualize mechanics to include 
                                in the game. My main role was making levels and testing our mechanics for bugs since I was experimenting with mechanics the most. I tried to 
                                create easy to difficult levels. When all the levels were finished, I went back over them to reorganize the levels so that the player learns
                                mechanics and the various ways to work with them in the order we want them to. In addition, for the levels to progressively get more difficult
                                but have some easier levels in between to prevent the player from feeling constantly stuck. For this project I learned how to use Trello for 
                                better team organization, tasks prioritization and distribution.
